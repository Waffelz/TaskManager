# Schedulerbot

A slack bot that allows team members to actively schedule tasks onto google calendar.
This project used slack API, google's API.AI, and google calendar api.
Once the user messages the slack bot asking to create a reminder for a certain task on a certain date, api ai parses for the particular task and date and ultimately adds it to the user's calendar after the authentication process is allowed.
